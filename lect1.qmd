## Regression:

We observe a quantitative response $Y$ and $p$
diferent predictors, $X1, X2,...,Xp$. We assume that there is some
relationship between $Y$ and $X = (X1, X2,...,Xp)$, which can be written
in the very general form as $Y = f(X) +\epsilon $, where $f$ is some fxed but unknown function of $X_1,...,X_p$, and $\epsilon$ is a random error term, which is independent of $X$ and has mean zero. When $Y$ is qualitative, we can this a regression problem. 

## Inference VS Prediction

**Inference**: Focuses on finding the relationship and association between predictors and reponse

**Prediction**: Focuses on finding $\hat(Y)$ for an unseen $X$.


## mean squared error (MSE)

## out-of-sample error

$E(Y^*âˆ’\hat{Y}^*)^22$

## in-sample error
