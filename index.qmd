title: "Estimation of out-of-sample prediction error in regression"
---

## Lecture 1:

### learning outcomes:
By the end of this lectures students should be able to:
 - understand the difference between inference and prediction in regression (reminder)
 - understand the difference between in-sample and out-of-sample prediction errors and define them
 - understand the imporance of out-of-sample prediction error
 - estimate out-of-sample prediction error via (in-sample) training error in linear regression
 - understand the draw back of estimating the out-of-sample prediction error via training error
 - understand the Bias-Variance Trade-Off


## Lecture 2:

### learning outcomes:
By the end of this lecture students should be able to:
 - understand what resampling methods are
 - estimate out-of-sample prediction error via Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
 - etimate out-of-sample prediction error via k-Fold Cross-Validation
 - undetstand the pros and cons of using each method
 - understand Bias-Variance Trade-Of for k-Fold Cross-Validation
